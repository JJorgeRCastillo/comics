The powers usually reflect the number of nested loops in the system.Note that whenever there are multiple Big-Oâ€™s in an algorithm, the biggest class wins out because it usually dominates the scaling. We can see this in the example below which has both O(n^2) (two nested loops) and O(n^3) (three nested loops) but itâ€™s overall Big-O is We can see this by noticing the time that smaller classes like O(n^2) take in comparison with larger classes like O(n^3).",
